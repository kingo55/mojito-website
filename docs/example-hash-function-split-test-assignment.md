Hash-based user assignment brings many benefits to experimenters running split tests. It's used extensively [in the industry](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2007GuideControlledExperiments.pdf) (section 4.1.2, page 6), at companies like [LinkedIn, Google, Microsoft and others](https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/site-assets/pdfs/ABTestingSocialNetwork_share.pdf). Compared to the ephemeral random numbers generated from PRNGs on the client-side, hash-based decisioning gives you far greater control:

* Consistent assignment across devices & platforms
* Retroactively "track" users assigned but not tracked
* Exclude users who may have been exposed during your canary release (aka. spillover protection)
* The ability to "back-test" your assignment before launching it (e.g. see which treatment groups the last 30 days of users would have seen)

When you see how easy it is, you'll wonder why the old SaaS split testing tools don't offer this flexibility!

## How it works

We can turn a hash function into a PRNG by:

1. Calculating the hash of the `user ID` + `test salt`
2. Converting the resulting hex digest into an integer & dividing by the largest number in the space for a decision between `0` and `1`
3. Applying the resulting decisions to the user being bucketed `decision < 0.5 ? control() : treatment()`

The meta discussion around `cryptographic hash functions === PRNGs` is beyond the scope of this article, but there's a lot of discussion in the literature about why this works. And there's also some approachable Stack Overflow posts that make the case for Hash-based PRNGs.

### Hash functions

If you're unfamiliar with hash functions, like MD5/SHA256 etc, their purpose is to distill your input data down to a fixed-length hexadecimal string. It works like this:

And luckily for us, the hexadecimal output can be parsed into numbers, that lets us generate our decisions.

## Using hashes as your PRNG in Mojito

Using a user/cookie ID and Mojito's `decisionAdapter`, we can control how users are bucketed. We'll take the `user`/`cookie ID` and send it through a hashing function to deterministically generate a really good random number between 0 and 1, like so:

### 1. Hash the user's ID & the experiment's salt

Every time you generate the hash from this seed, you'll get the same result. For our purposes we use MD5 as the hashing function because its properties make it well-suited to a split testing. 

```js
var userId = '1234567';
var testSalt = 'ex3';
var seed = userId + testSalt;
// result: '1234567ex3'

var md5Hash = Mojito.utils.md5('1234567ex3'); 
// result: '404c9f9d26876611359c2a6472012d53'
```

### 2. Generate the decisions for an experiment

We can derive random numbers from the hexadecimal values in the hash digest `404c9f9d26876611359c2a6472012d53`, like so:

```js
parseInt('404c9f9d', 16);
// result: 1078763421 (0x404c9f9d)

parseInt('404c9f9d', 16) / 0xffffffff;
// result: 0.25116918172016023
```

For each test, we need to make 2-3 decisions. And each decision uses a new part of the hash:

1. Test sample rate: `0x404c9f9d / 0xffffffff` -> `0.25116918172016023`
2. Recipe assignment: `0x26876611 / 0xffffffff` -> `0.15050352019036736`

Each 'decision' produces over 4 billion values - more than enough granularity for our purposes (it's probably overkill).

While more secure cryptographic hash functions exist, we're after speed and reliability (why would users bother compromising MD5 hashes used for assignment?). It's the same hash function used by MSFT/LinkedIn et al, and from our testing at Mint Metrics, it produces very flat, even distributions:

### 3. Use the 'decisions' in your assignment

Consider the following experiment:

```yml
state: live
sampleRate: 0.5
id: ex3
name: Homepage button
recipes:
  '0':
    name: Control
    sampleRate: 0.1
  '1':
    name: Treatment
    sampleRate: 0.9
trigger: trigger.js
```

And taking the example decisions from the user above, we know the decisions they will get:

* Test sample rate: `0.251... < 0.5` -> Included in test
* Recipe assignment: `0.15... > 0.1` -> Assigned to `Treatment`

No matter when/where this user is bucketed (e.g. app/web/server) they will **always** get the same decisions because of their user ID.

## Apply it in Mojito

Hopefully, this gets you excited about using hash functions in your split tests.

Mojito users are free to override the default `decisionAdapater` and use their own hashing functions and logic. Don't like `MD5`? Go with `SHA-256`! Prefer adding more salt? It's up to you.

See the [API reference for the decision adapter](js-delivery-api-decision-adapter) for more details and to implement your own.
