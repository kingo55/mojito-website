We've now created a new dedicated resource for Mojito documentation and guides. This site should help new and existing Mojito users with making the most out of Mojito.

We intend for this site to host resources such as:

-   Getting started with Mojito
-   Detailed documentation
-   Mojito release announcements
-   Showcasing unique usecases and the users of Mojito

To contact us, you may like to reach out to us at [Mint Metrics](https://mintmetrics.io/contact/). You can also follow / contribute to the Mojito Documentation through [the website git repo here](https://github.com/mint-metrics/mojito-website).
