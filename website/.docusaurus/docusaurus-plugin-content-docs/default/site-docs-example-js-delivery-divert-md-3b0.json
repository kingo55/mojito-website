  "description": "When an experiment you run is wildly successful, you may want to send 100% of eligible traffic to the variant after completion. Usually we recommend hard-coding successful recipes, but when developer resources are scarce and the feature is delivering lots of value, you can use Mojito to divert traffic to the winner temporarily.",
